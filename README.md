# StratosPeer

**S**tratos**P**eer is a _**fabulous**_ way to aggregate all your remote files, providing quick and easy access to all your project files across different cloud services. Be it Box or GitHub, all your files are just a search away. Can't remember which service you put that file with all your `passwords`? Have no fear, you have **S**tratos**P**eer :relaxed: ! Also...don't do that, that's very stupid.
