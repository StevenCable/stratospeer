## Getting Started with RESTful API: 

### Some FYI first:

**Note** With the Drive platform, you'll use a model based on file IDs rather than a traditional directory hierarchy. See the following links for more on [Working with Folders][working-with-folders] and [Managing File Metadata][managing-file-metadata] 

## Quickstarting

### Search for Files
> A simple way to search for files is with the `files.list` method of the Drive API. More can be learned here:
> [File.List][file.list]
**AND** 
>[Search for Files][search-files]
